DEPRECATED: Navigation Screenplay Generator

This script has been deprecated in favor of the natural speaker-turn format.
All markdown output now uses natural speaker-turn formatting instead of 
fixed-duration navigation segments.

Use the following instead:
- processor-aai.py for manual processing with speaker renaming
- batch-process.py for automated processing 
- transcribe-pipeline.py for interactive processing

These scripts now generate natural speaker-turn screenplays that are both
readable and navigable through speaker-change timestamps.
